Unit8 : Transaction and Query Processing


1.Introduction to transaction
    * a transaction is a sequence of database operations performed as a single 
    logical  unit of work.  
    * transactions ensure data integrity and consistency in a database by following 
    the ACID properties:  
        - Atomicity: All operations in a transaction are completed or none are.  
        - Consistency: A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.  
        - Isolation: Transactions do not interfere with each other.  
        - Durability: Once committed, changes from a transaction are permanent.  
    * transactions help handle errors, system failures, and concurrent access in databases.


2. State of a Transaction:
    - A transaction goes through several states during its execution. 
    - These states help in tracking the progress and managing the outcome of transactions. 
    - The main states of a transaction are: 
        a. Active: - The transaction is currently being executed. 
                    - Operations like read/write are taking place. 
        b. Partially Committed: - All operations have been executed, 
                                but the final commit is yet to be done. 
        c. Committed: - Changes made by the transaction are saved permanently. 
                        - The transaction has completed successfully. 
        d. Failed: - An error occurred, and the transaction cannot proceed further. 
        e. Aborted: - The transaction has been rolled back. 
                    - Database is restored to its previous state.

3. ACID Properties
    - ACID is a set of properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. 
    - It stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 

        a. Atomicity: 
            - Ensures that all operations within a transaction are 
            completed successfully. 
            - If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back. 
        
        b. Consistency: 
            - Guarantees that a transaction transforms the database from one 
                valid state to another valid state. 
            - Maintains data integrity before and after the transaction.
        
        c. Isolation: 
            - Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. 
            - The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to others. 
        
        d. Durability: 
            - Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent. 
            - Data remains safe even if the system crashes after the transaction.

4. Introduction to Concurrency Control: 
    - Concurrency control is a technique used to ensure that multiple transactions 
        can occur simultaneously without causing data inconsistency. 
    - It helps maintain data integrity and isolation in a multi-user environment. 
    - Without proper concurrency control, problems like lost updates, dirty reads, 
        and uncommitted data can occur. 
    - Common concurrency control techniques include: 

        a. Lock-based Protocols: 
            - Use locks to control access to data items. 
            - Types of locks include shared locks (read) and exclusive locks (write). 
            - Ensures that only one transaction can modify data at a time. 

        b. Timestamp-based Protocols: 
            - Assign a unique timestamp to each transaction. 
            - Transactions execute based on their timestamps to maintain serial order. 
            - Prevents conflicts by comparing timestamps during operations. 

        c. Validation-based Protocols: 
            - Also called optimistic concurrency control. 
            - Transactions go through three phases: 
                a.read, 
                b.validation, and 
                c.write. 
            - A transaction is allowed to commit only if it does not conflict with 
                others during the validation phase. 

        d. Serializability: 
            - when many transactions run together, the final result should be the 
                same as if they were run one after another. 
            - It helps make sure the database stays correct even when multiple users 
                work at the same time.

        e. Conflict Serializability: 
            - A specific type of serializability where transactions are reordered 
                by swapping non-conflicting operations. 
            - Two operations conflict if they belong to different transactions and 
                access the same data item, and at least one is a write operation.


5. Introduction to Query Processing: 
    - Query processing is the series of steps the database system takes to execute 
        a query and return the desired results. 
    - It transforms a high-level query (like SQL) into efficient low-level 
        operations that access the data. 
    - The goal is to find the best way to get data quickly and correctly. 
    - Main stages of query processing include: parsing, optimization, and execution. 
    - Good query processing improves performance and reduces resource use in 
        the database.

6. Steps Used in Query Processing: 
    - Query processing involves several key steps to execute a query efficiently 
        and correctly. 
    - The main steps of query processing are: 

        a. Parsing and Translation: 
            - The query is checked for correct syntax and translated into an 
                internal format called a query tree or query graph. 

        b. Query Optimization: 
            - The system finds the most efficient way to execute the query 
                by considering different query plans. 
            - The optimizer estimates costs like CPU time and disk I/O for each plan. 

        c. Query Evaluation: 
            - The chosen query plan is executed by accessing the database and 
                performing operations like joins, selections, and projections. 
        
        d. Result Formatting: 
            - The results are formatted and returned to the user or application.


7. Introduction to Lock Management: 
    - Lock management is a method used to control access to data in a database 
        during transactions to ensure concurrency and consistency. 
    - Locks prevent multiple transactions from accessing the same data simultaneously 
        in ways that could cause conflicts or errors. 
    - The lock manager keeps track of all locks and grants or denies lock requests 
        based on the current state. 
    - Types of locks include: 

        a.Shared Locks (S-Locks): 
            -Allow multiple transactions to read the same data item at the same 
                time without interfering with each other. 
            -No transaction can write to the data item while shared locks are held. 
            -Useful when many users need to view data concurrently but not modify it. 

        b.Exclusive Locks (X-Locks): 
            -Allow only one transaction to write or modify a data item at a time. 
            -When an exclusive lock is held on a data item, no other transaction can 
                read or write it until the lock is released. 
            -Ensures data integrity by preventing simultaneous conflicting updates. 
            -Proper lock management helps avoid problems like lost updates and deadlocks.


8. Lock Conversions: 
    - Lock conversion is the process of changing a lock held by a transaction on 
        a data item from one type to another to allow different kinds of operations. 
    - Commonly, a transaction may start with a shared lock when reading data and 
        later need to convert it to an exclusive lock if it wants to update that data. 
    - Lock conversion must be carefully managed to avoid conflicts and ensure data 
        consistency. 
    - If the requested conversion is not possible immediately (because another 
        transaction holds a conflicting lock), 
        the requesting transaction may have to wait or be rolled back to prevent deadlocks. 
    - Proper lock conversion helps improve concurrency by allowing transactions 
        to change  locks as needed.


9. Dealing with Deadlocks: 
    - Deadlocks happen when two or more transactions wait for each other’s locks 
        and none can move forward, so they get stuck. 
    - To fix deadlocks, database systems use different ways: 
    
        a. Deadlock Prevention: 
            -Deadlock prevention is a technique where the system ensures that 
                deadlocks never occur by controlling how transactions acquire locks.
            -The system stops transactions from getting locks in an order 
                that can cause deadlocks. 
            -Sometimes it uses time limits to avoid waiting too long. 
            -Uses fixed lock order.
            -Avoids circular wait.
        
        b. Deadlock Detection: 
            -Deadlock detection is a method where the system monitors transaction 
                activities to identify circular wait conditions (deadlocks) when they occur.
            -The system checks regularly to find if transactions are stuck 
                waiting in a circle. 
            -If it finds this, it knows a deadlock happened. 
        
        c. Deadlock Resolution: 
            -Deadlock resolution is the process of removing deadlocks after they are 
                detected by aborting one or more transactions.
            -After finding a deadlock, the system stops one or more transactions to 
                break the deadlock and let others continue. 
            -The system may choose which transaction to abort based on factors like 
                transaction priority, waiting period, or the amount of work done.
        
        d. Timeouts: 
            -Timeouts are a simple technique where a transaction is automatically 
                aborted if it waits too long for a resource.
            -If a transaction waits too long for a lock, the system cancels it 
                to avoid deadlocks. 
            - Handling deadlocks well helps keep the database working smoothly and 
                available for users.
            -Timeouts are easier to implement but may cause unnecessary aborts, even 
                when a deadlock hasn’t actually occurred.


10. Introduction to Crash Recovery: 
    - Crash recovery is the process of restoring a database to a correct state 
        after a failure, such as a power outage or system crash. 
    - Its goal is to make sure the database stays consistent and no data is lost 
        or corrupted. 
    - The recovery system uses logs and backups to undo incomplete transactions 
        and redo committed ones. 
    - Proper crash recovery helps protect data and ensures the database can 
        continue working smoothly after problems.


11. The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Protocol: 
    - The Write-Ahead Log protocol ensures that all changes made by a transaction 
        are first recorded in a log before they are applied to the database. 
    - This log records details of the transaction’s actions, so if a crash happens, 
        the system can use the log to recover. 
    - WAL guarantees that no data changes are lost and helps maintain durability 
        and atomicity of transactions. 
    - By writing to the log first, the database can undo or redo transactions 
        during recovery to keep data consistent.
