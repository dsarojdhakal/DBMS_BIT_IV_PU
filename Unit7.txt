Unit 7 : Database Security
---------------------------------------

    - Database security refers to the processes, technologies, and measures 
        used to protect a database from unauthorized access, misuse, or 
        malicious threats. 
    -   It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
        data stored in the database.


1.Different Levels of Database Security:
    a. Physical Level Security:
        - Protects the hardware and physical devices where the database resides.
        - Includes measures like restricted access to server rooms, 
        surveillance, and disaster recovery plans.
    b. Operating System Level Security:
        - Secures the operating system hosting the database.
        - Involves user authentication, permissions, and regular updates.
    c. Database Level Security:
        - Controls access to the database itself.
        - Uses user accounts, roles, privileges, and encryption.
    d. Application Level Security:
        - Ensures that applications interacting with the database are secure.
        - Includes input validation, secure coding practices, and 
            proper authentication.
    e. Network Level Security:
        - Protects data as it travels across networks.
        - Uses firewalls, VPNs, SSL/TLS encryption.



2. Access Control:
    - Access control is a fundamental aspect of database security.
    - It determines who can access the database and what operations
     they can perform.
    - Common mechanisms include:
        a. Authentication: Verifying the identity of users 
            (e.g., username/password, biometrics).
        b. Authorization: Granting permissions to users based 
            on roles.
        c. Auditing: Tracking and recording user activities 
            for monitoring and compliance.
    - Proper access control helps prevent unauthorized data access, 
        modification, or deletion.



3. Authentication in Database Security:
    - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity 
        of users who are trying to access the database.
    - It ensures that only authorized individuals can log in 
        and interact with the database.
    - Common authentication methods include:
        a. Password-based authentication: Users provide a username and password.
        b. Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Requires two or more verification 
            methods (e.g., password and OTP).
        c. Biometric authentication: Uses fingerprints, facial recognition.
        d. Certificate-based authentication: Utilizes digital certificates to verify identity.
    - Strong authentication mechanisms help prevent unauthorized 
        access and protect sensitive data.



4. Authorization in Database Security:
    - Authorization is the process of determining what actions 
        an authenticated user is allowed to perform on the database.
    - It involves assigning privileges and roles to users based on their responsibilities.
    - Common authorization mechanisms include:
        a. Role-based access control (RBAC): Users are assigned roles, 
            and each role has specific permissions.
        b. Privilege management: Granting or revoking rights to perform operations 
            such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
        c. Object-level permissions: Controlling access to specific tables, 
            views, or procedures.
    - Proper authorization ensures that users can only access and modify data 
        relevant to their role, reducing the risk of data breaches or misuse.



5. Non-repudiation in Database Security:
    - Non-repudiation ensures that actions or transactions performed in the 
        database cannot be denied by the user who performed them.
    - It provides proof of the origin and integrity of data and operations.
    - Common mechanisms include:
        a. Digital signatures: Used to verify the identity of users and 
            the authenticity of transactions.
        b. Audit trails: Detailed logs that record user activities, changes, 
            and access events.
        c. Time-stamping: Attaching time information to transactions 
            to establish when actions occurred.
    - Non-repudiation is important for accountability, compliance, and forensic 
        investigations in database environments.



6. Encryption and Decryption in Database Security:
    - Encryption is the process of converting data into a coded format 
        to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back to its 
        original form for authorized users.
    - Encryption helps protect sensitive data both at rest (stored in the 
        database) and in transit (moving across networks).
    - Common encryption mechanisms include:
        a. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE): Automatically encrypts database 
            files at the storage level.
        b. Column-level encryption: Encrypts specific columns containing 
            sensitive information.
        c. End-to-end encryption: Ensures data is encrypted from the source to 
            the destination.
        d. SSL/TLS encryption: Secures data transmitted between clients and the
             database server.
    - Proper key management is essential to ensure only authorized users can 
        decrypt and access the data.
    - Encryption and decryption are critical for maintaining data confidentiality 
        and compliance with security standards.
