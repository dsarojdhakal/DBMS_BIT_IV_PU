Unit 9: Backup and Recovery


1.Introduction 
    - Backup and recovery are crucial for maintaining data integrity and 
        availability in DBMS.
    - Backups protect against data loss from system crashes, media failures, 
        and application errors.
    - Recovery techniques restore the database to a consistent state after failures.
    - Effective backup and recovery minimize downtime and prevent loss of critical 
        information.


2.Failure of Database System 
    - Database systems can fail due to:
        a. hardware faults,
        b. software bugs,
        c. power outages, or
        d. human errors.
    - Such failures may lead to loss or corruption of data, making backup and 
        recovery essential.
    - Backup strategies ensure that a copy of the database is available for restoration.
    - Recovery techniques help restore the database to its last consistent state, 
        minimizing data loss.
    - Proper backup and recovery planning reduces the impact of failures and ensures 
        business continuity.


3.Backup Devices
    - Backup devices are hardware or storage media used to store database backups.
    - Common backup devices include:
        a. Magnetic tapes: Traditionally used for large-scale backups and storage.
        b. Hard disk drives (HDDs): Used for fast and reliable backup storage.
        c. Solid-state drives (SSDs): Provide faster backup and recovery operations.
        d. Optical media (CD/DVD/Blu-ray): Suitable for small-scale or long-term 
            backups.
        e. Network-attached storage (NAS): Enables centralized backup storage 
            accessible over a network.
        f. Cloud storage: Offers scalable, offsite backup solutions with remote 
            accessibility.
    - The choice of backup device depends on factors such as data volume, speed 
        requirements, cost, and recovery objectives.
    - Regular testing and maintenance of backup devices are essential to ensure 
        successful data restoration when needed.


4.Backup of Database and Database System
    - Database backup refers to creating a copy of the database data and schema 
        to Protects against data loss.
    - Backups can be performed at different levels:
        a. Physical backup: Copies the actual database files (data files, log files, 
            control files).
        b. Logical backup: Exports database objects (tables, views, procedures) and 
            their data.
    - Database system backup may also include configuration files and scripts 
        necessary for system restoration.
    - Regular backups are essential to ensure that both data and system components 
        can be recovered after a failure.
    - Backup frequency and retention policies should be defined based on business 
        requirements and regulatory compliance.
    - Automated backup solutions help reduce human error and ensure consistency 
        in backup operations.
    - Secure storage and encryption of backups are important to protect sensitive 
        data from unauthorized access.


5.Techniques Used in Recovery of Database System
    - Recovery techniques are employed to restore the database to a consistent state 
        after a failure. Common techniques include:

        a. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): 
            - All changes are first recorded in a log before being applied to the 
                database.
            - Ensures that committed transactions can be redone and uncommitted 
                transactions can be undone during recovery.

        b. Checkpoints:
            - Periodic checks of the database state are taken.
            - Simplifies recovery by reducing the amount of log data that needs to 
                be processed.

        c. Shadow Paging:
            - Maintains two copies of the database pages: current and shadow.
            - Changes are made to the current pages, and the shadow pages are used 
                for recovery if a failure occurs.

        d. Immediate Update and Deferred Update:
            - Immediate update: Changes are applied to the database as soon as a 
                transaction issues an update.
            - Deferred update: Changes are applied only after a transaction 
                successfully commits.


        e. Redo and Undo Operations:
            - Redo: Reapplies changes of committed transactions.
            - Undo: Reverses changes of uncommitted transactions.

    - These techniques help ensure data integrity, consistency, and durability 
        in the event of system crashes, media failures, or other errors.
